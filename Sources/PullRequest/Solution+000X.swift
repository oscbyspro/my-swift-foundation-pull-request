Since this is intended to only be a transient value, for the purposes of translating from BinaryInteger to the ICU libraries, this is the right compromise of runtime speed (CPU time) and memory efficiency (it's usually only off by a byte or two, if that).

        // Fast-path for values that fit into a UInt, as the conversion to a UInt should be virtually free if it's possible (it's essentially just self.words[0]) and there's a specialisation of this function for UInt that's faster.

        // The algorithm here is conceptually fairly simple.  In a nutshell, the value of self is broken down into Word-sized chunks, each of which is divided by ten repeatedly until the value dimishes to zero.  The remainder of each division is the next digit of the result (starting with the least significant).
        //
        // A conceptually simpler approach is to skip the first step of breaking things into Word-sized chunks, and just do the division by 10 on the whole value of `self`.  The difference is performance - native integer division (for machine-word-sized integers) is essentially O(1), whereas division of arbitrary-precision integers is essentially O(log2(bitWidth)) since it's composed of _multiple_ machine-word-sized divides proportionate to its binary magnitude.
        //
        // So we replace some of those expensive O(log2(bitWidth)) divides with simpler O(1) divides, by first dividing by the largest multiple of ten such that the remainder fits in a single machine word (UInt), and then using regular integer division CPU instructions to further divide that simple machine-word-sized remainder down into individual digits.

"negative" : "positive (or zero)") yet the remainder of division by \(wordMagnitude) is not: \(remainder).  quotientAndRemainder(dividingBy:) is not implemented correctly for \(type(of: self)) (it might be using F-division instead of T-division).") // It's an entirely understandable error for an implementor to use F-division for their integer quotient and remainder, but they're supposed to use T-division.  i.e. the quotient is supposed to be rounded towards zero rather than down (and that effects the modulus correspondingly, since either way the results must satisfy r = d â¨‰ (r idiv i) + (r mod i)).  T-division is convenient because its remainder is neatly the value of interest to this algorithm, rather than being offset by the divisor if r is negative.  While it would be technically possible to assume F-division if the remainder's sign doesn't match, the incorrect implementation of quotientAndRemainder(dividingBy:) will probably still break other algorithms and so we shouldn't encourage it.
